## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main components:

1. **🌐 Client**: Frontend applications for user interaction.
   - **Flood Detection System Client**
   - **Pothole Detection System Client**
2. **📏 Distance**: Arduino-based ultrasonic sensor system for measuring water levels.
3. **🖥️ Server**: Backend server for data handling and API endpoints.
4. **🤖 Pothole Detection**: AI-based system for detecting potholes on roads.

## 📘 Introduction

The **Flood Monitoring and Pothole Detection System** is a smart solution designed to monitor urban flooding and detect potholes on roads. It integrates hardware, software, and AI-based technologies to provide real-time data, alerts, and insights for safer and smarter cities.

## 🛠️ Installation

### 🔹 Flood Detection Client
```bash
cd client/flood-detection-system
npm install
npm run dev
````

### 🔹 Pothole Detection Client

```bash
cd client/pothole-detection-system
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 🔹 Backend Server

```bash
cd server
npm install
node index.js
```

### 🔹 Distance Sensor (Arduino)

1. Open `distance/distance.ino` in Arduino IDE
2. Update your:
   - Wi-Fi SSID and Password
   - Backend URL
3. Upload to your NodeMCU/Wemos board

---

## 🧪 Usage

- Frontend will run on `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`
- Sensor data will be posted to backend in real-time
- Use pothole detection interface to test with images/video

---

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### Flood Monitoring

- `GET /api/location` → Get current flood levels
- `POST /api/location` → Receive sensor data (from hardware)

### Pothole Detection (example if extended)

- `POST /api/potholes` → Upload image for detection
- `GET /api/potholes` → Fetch recent detections
